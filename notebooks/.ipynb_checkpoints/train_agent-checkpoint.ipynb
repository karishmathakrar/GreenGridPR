    "# Overview\n",
    "## State Space\n",
    "- The state space consists of an 80,000-cell grid, representing different geographical locations in Puerto Rico.\n",
    "- Each cell has attributes like solar PV output, wind power density, elevation, slope, cyclone risk score, building density, road density, and distance to transmission lines.\n",
    "- Approximately 70% of cells are unavailable for development due to environmental or other constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Action Space\n",
    "- Two types of actions are available: building a solar array or a wind turbine.\n",
    "- Actions can be taken on any available cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rewards and Costs\n",
    "The reward function should incorporate:\n",
    "- Energy production potential (solar and wind).\n",
    "- Costs or penalties associated with building on certain terrains (e.g., high elevation or steep slopes).\n",
    "- Penalties for building in high cyclone risk areas.\n",
    "- Incentives for maintaining a balance between solar and wind energy.\n",
    "- Incentives for early deployment and distributed grid development.\n",
    "- Penalties for high building or road density areas.\n",
    "- Distance to transmission lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "## RL Model\n",
    "- Model Choice: Given the size of the state space, a model-based RL algorithm (like Deep Q-Networks or Actor-Critic methods) is suitable.\n",
    "- Representation: The state representation should include the current status of each grid cell (whether it has a solar array, a wind turbine, or is vacant) along with its attributes.\n",
    "- Sequence of Actions: The RL agent will sequentially choose actions (where to build next) based on the current state of the grid.\n",
    "- Terminal State: The agent is done when the environment reaches a certain level of energy capacity or after a fixed number of steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Implementation Steps\n",
    "## Environment Setup: \n",
    "- Implement the environment to reflect the grid and its dynamics, including applying the binary mask for unavailable cells.\n",
    "- The step(action) method should update the grid state based on the chosen action and calculate the immediate reward or cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Agent Development:\n",
    "- Use PyTorch for implementing the neural network models for the agent.\n",
    "The agent needs to learn a policy that maximizes long-term rewards, considering the complex reward structure and large state space.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training and Evaluation:\n",
    "- Set up a training loop where the agent interacts with the environment, receives feedback, and improves its policy.\n",
    "- Periodically evaluate the agent's performance, possibly using separate evaluation episodes or metrics like total energy capacity achieved or adherence to environmental constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hyperparameter Tuning:\n",
    "- Adjust learning rates, exploration rates, discount factors, and network architecture as needed to improve performance.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Scalability:\n",
    "Due to the large state space, may need to:\n",
    "- use function approximation for value functions\n",
    "- prioritizing important experiences in the replay buffer\n",
    "- parallelize computation process\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualization and Analysis:\n",
    "- Develop tools to visualize the evolving grid layout and analyze the trade-offs made by the RL agent between different objectives (like energy maximization vs. environmental constraints)."
